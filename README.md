# Garud carpool app

An experimental app for optimizing cab sharing to my work place Shiv Nadar University and back to my home Greater Noida.

- Any cab or car who is availabe to take rides will register to this app.
- All cabs which are available will be visible to passengers.
    - Passengers book a  seat in the cab by paying through UPI button.
    - Seats automatically gets updated as the booking continues.
    - Passengers add pick and drop address while booking.
- Once the ride starts, the driver hits the route button. A route is mapped for him through google map api to pick and drop in an optimized manner.
